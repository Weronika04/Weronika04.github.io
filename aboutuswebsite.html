    <h1> The beginnings of our School
    </h1>
    <p> Our school was launched in 2012 and has developed continuously since then. 
        Currently, we have offices throughout the tri-city with plans to expand our activities in other cities and voivodeships. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the American English School, we follow a coherent teaching strategy based on the best standards, which are confirmed by numerous awards and quality certificates. 
        Students who cross the threshold of our school are supervised by highly qualified teachers. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        We work for people with passion who carry out the schoolâ€™s mission professionally and with dedication.
</p>

<h2> What makes us special? </h2>
<p> We were one of the first language schools in Poland that have equipped all the classrooms with modern interactive boards. 
    Such boards make learning language much more interesting and engaging. 
</p>
    <p>   
    Interactive whiteboards offer our speakers the opportunity to use a variety of multimedia materials. 
    The dynamic and interactive message focuses attention in order to better understand and remember the material presented in the classroom.
